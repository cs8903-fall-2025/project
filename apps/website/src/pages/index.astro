    <Section id="overview" title="Project Overview">
        <p>This research project explores the potential of TinyML to revolutionize educational assessment in resource-constrained environments. Our work focuses on developing offline, automated grading systems that can operate without reliable internet connectivity while maintaining privacy, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability.</p>
        <p>The project addresses the critical need for accessible educational technology solutions that can function in diverse global contexts, from rural schools with limited infrastructure to privacy-conscious institutions seeking to keep student data local.</p>

    <Section id="literature-review" title="Literature Review" status="in progress">
      <p>Our comprehensive literature review examines the current state of TinyML applications in educational contexts, analyzing the hardware and software ecosystem while identifying research gaps in offline AI assessment tools.</p>
      <h3>Research Questions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>RQ1</strong> &mdash; What is the current state of the TinyML hardware and software ecosystem?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RQ2</strong> &mdash; How do existing modules compare in terms of performance, energy consumption, and cost effectiveness?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RQ3</strong> &mdash; What specific technical requirements and constraints must be addressed to adapt TinyML systems to educational outcomes such as automated assessment tasks?
        </li>

    <Section id="dashboard" title="Results Dashboard" status="coming soon">
      <p>We are a developing a literature review results dashboard to present device cost range, power consumption, and TinyML applications.</p>
    </Section>

    <Section id="proof-of-concept" title="Proof of Concept" status="in progress">
        <p>We are developing a functional demonstration of automated grading using TinyML/Edge AI devices. The system captures images of student homework, converts handwriting to text using OCR, and evaluates responses against predefined rubric in offline mode with modest computational resources.</p>
    </Section>

    <Section id="demo" title="Demo Video" status="coming soon">
      <p>A demo video of the proof of concept will demonstrate ingesting a sample homework image and seeing real-time OCR processing and rubric-based evaluation.</p>
