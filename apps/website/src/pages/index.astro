    <Section id="overview" title="Project Overview">
        <p>This research project explores the potential of TinyML to revolutionize educational assessment in resource-constrained environments. Our work focuses on developing offline, automated grading systems that can operate without reliable internet connectivity while maintaining privacy, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability.</p>
        <p>The project addresses the critical need for accessible educational technology solutions that can function in diverse global contexts, from rural schools with limited infrastructure to privacy-conscious institutions seeking to keep student data local.</p>

    <Section id="proof-of-concept" title="Proof of Concept" status="completed">
      <p>
        We developed a functional demonstration of automated grading using TinyML/Edge AI devices. The system captures images of student homework, converts handwriting to text using OCR, and evaluates responses against a rubric. All of this works offline, in a web browser, using modest computational resources.
      </p>
      <h3>System Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Internet connection:</strong> required to download the PWA and language model, after which it can be used offline.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Operating system:</strong> Windows 10 or 11, macOS 13+, Linux, or ChromeOS 16389.0.0+. ChromeOS is only supported on Chromebook Plus devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Browser:</strong> Google Chrome 142+. This is the only browser capable of running Gemini Nano models locally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hardware:</strong> Any desktop, laptop, tablet, or Chromebook Plus device capable of running the required browser and operating system. GPU is not required, but the device should have at least 4GB of VRAM, 16GB of RAM, and 4 CPU core. Mobile devices are not supported.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The proof of concept is available as a Progressive Web App (PWA) that can be installed on supported devices.
